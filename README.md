# 🚀 Playwright Complete Demo Framework (UI & API)

> **Important Note**: This repository is a sanitized standalone framework. It actively utilizes public demonstration sites (`the-internet.herokuapp.com` and `reqres.in`) to display modern testing architectures and methods. **No confidential project data, real URLs, credentials, or proprietary business logic will be found here.**

## 📖 Overview

A robust, enterprise-level automation framework built with TypeScript and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

This framework integrates end-to-end (E2E) UI testing with detailed API integration tests, providing a generic structure that is robust, parallel-safe, and production-ready.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Testing Engine:** `Playwright`
- **Language:** `TypeScript`
- **API Testing:** Built-in Playwright Request Context
- **Reporting:** `Playwright HTML Reporter`, `Allure` 
- **Configuration:** `dotenv`

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables Config**
   Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. Modify values if needed. (By default, public URLs and standard demo credentials are set).

3. **Install Browsers**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
   ```

## 🧪 Executing Tests

* **Headless execution (All Tests)**
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
  
* **Headed Execution (Visual Mode)**
  ```bash
  npm run test:headed
  ```
  
## 💡 Framework Quality Highlights

- **Agnostic Structure**: Ready to be cloned and integrated over any domain via `.env`.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Enforced object-oriented layout inside `/pages`.
- **Advanced Selectors**: Emphasizes generic role testing or unique attribute targeting for robustness.
- **Flakiness Mitigation**: Out-of-the-box parallelization capability combined with a configurable retry-hierarchy (`CI=1`/`Local=0`).
- **Resilient Waiting**: Complete removal of arbitrary `page.waitForTimeout` logic in favor of internal Playwright web-first assertions and actionability checks.
